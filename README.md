**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It was created in a desktop layout then adapted with Grid and media queries to fit several different device sizes.

**Description of Process**

This project was built utilizing Visual Studio Code while referencing the design created by TripleTen in Figma. The Spots project was verified and checked utilizing developer mode in Chrome. Especially when it came to checking the page's responsiveness. Great help from Prettier, Dot and the tutors at TripleTen as well on Discord.
